   I think the best takeaway from this class has been the process of managing development projects. 
Not only how to communicate with developers
but also how to do be efficient
For example, I think the section in class in which we used different
project management tools was a useful exercise,
but the best takeaway is that it doesn't really matter
which one you choose because they all have weaknesses
just don't spend all of your time choosing one.
The value of this class was more in the side comments 
and seemingly unplanned extra bits of information
than what was on the slides. 
   The content of the course was valuable, 
but the professor's experience with the subject matter
really provided extra value. 
For example, asking a developer to help you learn how to do it yourself, 
then allowing the developer to get so impatient that he takes over the project
was a helpful hint. I've done that by mistake before and never thought to
make it my strategy. 
   I also think that again, the lesson that each type of project
can be completed using a variety of programming languages
is very important. Knowing that there is no single best language
but that there are positives and negatives to each makes the decision 
process in choosing programmers, platforms and frameworks much easier. 
   When I arrived at the first class I did not know very much about managing 
development projects. The most improtant thing I now know is that I don't have to 
know everything about managing development projects to successfully manage one. 
I just need to know what I don't need to know, which I now know, thanks to this class.
